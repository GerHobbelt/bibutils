About
-----

[hs-bibutils] is library with Haskell bindings to Chris Putnam's
[bibutils], a library that interconverts between various bibliography
formats using a common MODS-format XML intermediate.

[hs-bibutils] can be used with [citeproc-hs] and [pandoc] to read and
use various bibliographic database formats for processing and
automatically formatting citations andreferences according to a [CSL]
style.

[citeproc-hs] adds to [pandoc], the famous [Haskell] text processing
tool, a Bibtex like citation and bibliographic formatting and
generation facility.

[CSL] is an XML language for specifying citation and bibliographic
formatting, similar in principle to BibTeX `.bst` files or the binary
style files in commercial products like Endnote or Reference Manager.

Download
--------

[hs-bibutils] can be downloaded from [Hackage]:

<http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/hs-bibutils>

To get the darcs source run:

        darcs get http://code.haskell.org/hs-bibutils/

Installation
------------

[hs-bibutils] requires [bibutils] version 4.0. Moreover, it requires
the [bibutils] library to be installed on your system.

At the present time, though, [bibutils] default compilation and
installation scripts only build a static library to be used for
building the various [bibutils]' binaries, the only ones being
installed.

In other words you need to either patch or download a patched version
of [bibutils] in order to build and install the library.[^1]

### Obtaining a patched version of bibutils

You can download a patched version of [bibutils] here:

<http://code.haskell.org/hs-bibutils/bibutils-4.0-ar.tar.gz>

To install it run:

        tar xvfz bibutils-4.0-ar.tar.gz
        cd bibutils-4.0-ar
        ./configure
        make

And now install it with, as root:

        make installlib

### Patching bibutils

You can patch [bibutils] by yourself.

Download version 4.0 from here:

<http://www.scripps.edu/~cdputnam/software/bibutils/bibutils_4.0_src.tgz>

and apply the patch that comes with the [hs-bibutils] source code,
`bibutils-4.0.patch`.

        tar xvfz bibutils-4.0.tar.gz
        cd bibutils-4.0
        patch -p0 < bibutils-4.0.patch

Now you can configure and build:

        ./configure
        make

And now as root:

        make installlib

### Installing hs-bibutils

Now you need install [hs-bibutils]. After unpacking the source code
run:

        runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --extra-include-dirs=/path/to/bibutils_4.0/lib

Change `/path/to/bibutils_4.0/lib` to point to the `lib` sub-directory
of the [bibutils] source code.

`--extra-include-dirs=/path/to/bibutils_4.0/lib` will tell the
compiler where to find the library header files needed to compile the
bindings.

Now you can build and install:

        runhaskell Setup.lhs build
        runhaskell Setup.lhs install

This last step requires `root` privileges.

If you don't have `root` privileges you can install [hs-bibutils]
locally with these commands:

        runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --extra-include-dirs=/path/to/bibutils_4.0/lib --user --prefix=$HOME
        runhaskell Setup.lhs build
        runhaskell Setup.lhs install --user
