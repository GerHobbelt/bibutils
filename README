% Haskell Bindings to Bibutils, the Bibliography Conversion Utilities

About
-----

[hs-bibutils] is library with Haskell bindings to Chris Putnam's
[bibutils], a library that interconverts between various bibliography
formats using a common MODS-format XML intermediate.

[hs-bibutils] can be used with [citeproc-hs] and [pandoc] to read and
use various bibliographic database formats for processing and
automatically formatting citations and references according to a [CSL]
style.

[citeproc-hs] adds to [pandoc], the famous [Haskell] text processing
tool, a Bibtex like citation and bibliographic formatting and
generation facility.

[CSL] is an XML language for specifying citation and bibliographic
formatting, similar in principle to BibTeX `.bst` files or the binary
style files in commercial products like Endnote or Reference Manager.

Download
--------

[hs-bibutils] can be downloaded from [Hackage]:

<http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/hs-bibutils>

To get the darcs source run:

        darcs get http://code.haskell.org/hs-bibutils/

Installation
------------

[hs-bibutils] does not require [bibutils] to be installed, since it
ships with its one version of the library. To build and install
[hs-bibutils] unpack the tar archive, in the source directory run:

        runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
        runhaskell Setup.lhs build
        runhaskell Setup.lhs install

This last step requires `root` privileges.

If you don't have `root` privileges you can install [hs-bibutils]
locally with these commands:

        runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --user --prefix=$HOME
        runhaskell Setup.lhs build
        runhaskell Setup.lhs install --user

[hs-bibutils] should be compatible with cabal-install.
