TODO for bibutils 

* Add a paragraph to long description describing (some of?) the tools.
* Consider not generating bibutils.1 during build process
* set shared library version number in some more transparent way than
  with a patch
* suggest to upstream harmonizing bibutils.dbk and rest of package (GPL-2 vs 
  GPL-2+).
* create -dbg package
