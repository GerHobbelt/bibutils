    Hi David and Chris,

    We support this effort, and grant permission to distribute under the 
    terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free 
    Software Foundation the contents of the following URL:

    Please be aware that we update the list occasionally (sometimes on a 
    weekly basis), with both additions and corrections.

    Thanks,
    -- Alberto
